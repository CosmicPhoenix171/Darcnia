# Emy – Interactions

## First Impressions
- Eyes glow faintly crimson, soot on hands and sleeves.
- Smells faintly of smoke and alchemical reagents.
- Talks about safety in the abstract, but never actually waits for people to stand back.

### Sample Openers
- "Don’t worry, the last one only exploded *sideways*. This one should go *up*. Probably."
- "You look like people who appreciate controlled chaos. How do you feel about experimental spellcraft?"
- "If this works, we’ll have a new school of magic. If it doesn’t, we’ll have a new crater. Win‑win!"

## In Conversation
- Will overshare magical theory, occasionally interrupting herself to jot notes.
- Becomes intensely focused when discussing fire, combustion, or dragons.
- Offers to "improve" existing magic items in ways that may be extremely risky.

## Party Dynamics
- **With cautious PCs:** She treats them as her safety officers, actually listening (sometimes) when they say "not here".
- **With reckless PCs:** Instant best friends and co‑conspirators.
- **With lawful/authority PCs:** Alternates between flattery ("esteemed inspector") and loophole‑hunting.

## Escalation / Conflict
- If restrained or banned from casting, Emy becomes twitchy, sketching diagrams and muttering.
- In danger, defaults to overkill: Burning Hands, Fire Bolt, anything that goes boom.

## Development Beats
- Gains a proper patron or institution to fund her research.
- Finally perfects a signature "Explosion" spell that becomes her hallmark.
- Forced to confront the real consequences of collateral damage she caused.
