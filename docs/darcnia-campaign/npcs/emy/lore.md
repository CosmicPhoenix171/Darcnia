# Emy – Lore

## Concept
An explosive gremlin of science and chaos, Emy treats magic as experimental artillery. She lives for the moment when theory collides with reality in a glorious fireball, even if the spell was only supposed to light a candle.

## Origin
- **Homeland / Region:** TBD (tie into Darcnia location later)
- **Family / Upbringing:** TBD – likely low‑status or orphan, obsessed with "forbidden" tomes.
- **Early Spark:** Discovered magic when a miscopied cantrip scroll detonated a workshop, leaving her unharmed but ecstatic.

## Motivations
- Prove that any problem can be solved with enough controlled explosions.
- Discover or invent the ultimate "Explosion" spell.
- Earn the grudging respect of more conservative scholars who see her as a walking hazard.

## Personality Notes
- Speaks too fast, especially when excited; jumps between topics.
- Treats near‑disasters as data points, not failures.
- Surprisingly loyal to anyone who doesn’t immediately try to shut down her experiments.

## Relationship Hooks
- **Mentor / Rival:** A senior archmage who keeps sponsoring her research while constantly paying for collateral damage.
- **Party Hook:** The party needs magical firepower or help dealing with dangerous artifacts; Emy offers help in exchange for field‑testing opportunities.
- **Antagonist Hook:** Local authorities consider her a public menace after a string of "incidents".
