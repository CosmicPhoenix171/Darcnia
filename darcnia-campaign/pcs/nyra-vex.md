## Guild of Crystalia Introduction

### Scene 1: The Job Only the Marked Can Take
A weathered envelope waits at Nyra's latest shelter — propped against the remains of a collapsed shrine, sealed with wax bearing the faded symbol of a fractured crystal.

Inside is a thin strip of parchment. It reads:

> "To the one who walks forgotten roads —
> A ruin has resurfaced below Skyreach. Lost since the first seal.
> Entry permitted only by guild authority. Payment guaranteed upon report.
> Crystalia needs ghosts who leave no footprints.
> Join. Take the mark. Collect what is owed."

There's no signature. Just a crudely sketched map and a small, flat token shaped like the guild crest.
It hums faintly when her fingers graze it.

### Scene 2: Arrival at Guild Crystalia
Lyra Windfern, the guild's bright and clumsy secretary, is startled when Nyra arrives with the ancient token.

**Lyra:** "We haven't issued one of those in years... you must be special! The Guildmaster will want to see you right away."

Lyra guides Nyra through the hall — a fading guild, banners worn thin, yet still alive with quiet purpose. She registers Nyra as a provisional member and leads her to meet the Guildmaster.

### Scene 3: Meeting Guildmaster Thorne
Guildmaster Eldon Thorne, eccentric but sharp, studies the token with deep familiarity.

**Thorne:** "The token chose you. We didn't. That means something — something older."

He grants her provisional membership, handing over a sealed mission scroll marked with a faint sigil:
"Level 3 — Skyreach Underspire."

**Thorne:** "You want answers? Earn them. Clear Level One. Then Level Two. Get stronger — the dungeon doesn't care who you are until you survive it."

He watches her quietly, like someone who already knows what she's going to become.

### Scene 4: The Mark of Crystalia
Lyra leads Nyra into a hidden induction chamber beneath the guild. Ancient runes shimmer across the walls. A silver flame rises in the center brazier.

**Lyra** (reverent): "Only those chosen by the token are branded here. The magic remembers."

She opens the ancient tome and reads the oath aloud. The runes pulse as her voice echoes, layered with something older.

#### Oath of Crystalia
> "I stand at the edge of forgotten paths,
> Where flame once fell and silence grew.
> I carry the crest not to lead — but to unlock.
> Not to command — but to remember.
> I swear upon ash, stone, and spark:
> When the seals crack, I will not look away.
> When the truth stirs, I will not run.
> I am the fracture.
> I am the flame.
> I am the shadow that walks back in."

As the final line fades, the silver fire surges around Nyra — and her skin glows along her left shoulder blade. The **Crest of Crystalia** burns itself into being: a fractured crystal encircled by faint, shifting runes of silver and blue.

**Thorne** (quietly from the doorway): "When the stone sings, you'll feel it too."

### Scene 5: The Whisper in the Fire
As the marking completes, Nyra hears something—a whisper woven into the crackling flames, distant and layered with echoes.

*"I see you..."*

The words seem to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. Was it the fire? The runes? Her own mind?

Nyra looks around, but Lyra seems oblivious, closing the ancient tome with reverence.

**Lyra:** "The mark is complete! Welcome to Guild Crystalia."

Later, as they leave the chamber, Nyra hesitates.

**Nyra:** "During the ceremony... did you hear anything? Like a voice?"

Lyra blinks. "A voice? No, just the usual magical resonance. Why?"

Nyra glances at Thorne, who has suddenly gone very still.

**Thorne** (carefully): "Sometimes the old magic... echoes. Fragments of intent woven into the ritual. Nothing to worry about."

But his expression says otherwise. His hands grip his staff a little tighter.

**Thorne:** "If you hear it again... let me know. Immediately."

The fear in his voice is subtle but unmistakable. He knows something he's not saying.

### Scene 6: The Locked Scroll
Nyra takes the sealed mission scroll in hand. The wax hums faintly, reacting to the glow of her tattoo. A pulse runs down her arm.

The seal cracks — and faint blue light spills through the parchment. Words appear for a heartbeat before fading:

> "Not yet forged.
> The mark must grow."

Then the scroll seals itself again.

**Thorne** (calmly): "That's as far as it's willing to talk to you. The token may have chosen you, but the dungeon hasn't. Not yet."

He meets her eyes.

**Thorne:** "You want answers? You want to know what's calling you? You need to get stronger first. Clear Level One. Then Level Two. Not as a tourist — as a survivor. When you come back from the dark with earned scars, that scroll will know. So will your mark."

He gestures to the hall.

**Thorne:** "You've got the key. Now earn the lock."

### Scene 7: The Offer of Rest
As Thorne leaves, Lyra peeks in with her usual cheerful energy.

**Lyra:** "You must be tired! Want to stay here for the night, or do you have a place in the city?"

**Nyra:** "That's fine... I'll stay here if that's okay."

**Lyra** (grinning): "Of course! Totally fine! That'll be twenty-five gold a night — no breakfast, no refunds, and you have to feed the mimic."

She pauses. Then, laughing: "Kidding. It's free. Unless you actually want to pay me. I won't stop you."

She gestures for Nyra to follow.

**Lyra:** "Come on, I'll show you to the barracks. You get a bunk, a chest, and a wall hook that probably won't fall off in your sleep. Fair warning, the guy two beds over snores like a collapsing dragon."
