**Difficulty**: Medium (exploration + skill challenge + optional combat)  
**Party Level**: 1-3

## Setup

Eldon Thorne pulls the party aside with a concerned expression.

**Boxed Text**:
> "I hate to trouble you so soon after your arrival, but... well, there's been strange noises coming from the lower levels. Dreams, too. Some of the younger members report seeing a silver-haired woman in their sleep, reaching out. I'd investigate myself, but these old bones don't move like they used to. Would you mind taking a look?"
