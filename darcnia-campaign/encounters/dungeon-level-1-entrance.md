**Difficulty**: Medium (CR 2-3 for level 2-3 party)  
**Party Level**: 2-3

---

## Arrival at the Dungeon

The party receives official clearance from Guild Crystalia to enter the dungeon.

**Boxed Text**:
> "The entrance to the dungeon dominates the center of Heart Plaza - a massive archway of dark stone carved with celestial symbols and warning runes. Guild guards check your credentials and step aside. Beyond the arch, stone stairs descend into flickering torchlight. The air grows colder with each step down.
> 
> At the bottom, you enter a vast circular chamber. The walls are covered in faded carvings showing a woman with outstretched arms, surrounded by stars. The ceiling is lost in shadow. Three passages lead deeper, each marked with a different sigil: Sun, Moon, and Star."

## Guardians: Animated Armor (2)

When the party approaches any of the three exits, stone dust falls from alcoves and two suits of armor animate.

**Boxed Text**:
> "As you step toward the [direction] passage, grinding stone echoes through the chamber. Two alcoves you hadn't noticed before crack open, and ancient suits of armor step forward with mechanical precision. Their visors glow with pale blue light - the same color as your guild tattoos."

### Animated Armor (2)
**Medium construct, unaligned**

- **AC** 18 (natural armor)
- **HP** 33 (6d8 + 6)
- **Speed** 25 ft.

**STR** 14 (+2) | **DEX** 11 (+0) | **CON** 13 (+1) | **INT** 1 (−5) | **WIS** 3 (−4) | **CHA** 1 (−5)

- **Damage Immunities** poison, psychic
- **Condition Immunities** blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned
- **Senses** blindsight 60 ft. (blind beyond this radius), passive Perception 6
- **Languages** —
- **Challenge** 1 (200 XP each)

**Antimagic Susceptibility**: The armor is incapacitated while in the area of an antimagic field. If targeted by dispel magic, the armor must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall unconscious for 1 minute.

**False Appearance**: While motionless, the armor is indistinguishable from a normal suit of armor.

### Actions
- **Multiattack**: The armor makes two melee attacks.
- **Slam**: Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage.

---

## Tactics

### Animated Armor Behavior
- **Round 1**: Position to block both exits from the party
- **Round 2+**: Focus attacks on whoever damaged them most recently
- **Special**: If party shows guild crest tattoos as an action, armor hesitates (DC 13 Persuasion to make them stand down for 1 round)
- **Morale**: Fight until destroyed (constructs)

### Terrain Features
- **Pillars**: Four stone pillars provide half cover
- **Central Seal**: Counts as difficult terrain (uneven stone)
- **Alcoves**: Provide full cover if party retreats into them

---

## Alternative Resolution: The Tattoo Test

**If a character uses their action to display their Guild Crest Tattoo and succeeds on a DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion) check**:
- The armor pauses, visors flickering
- Ancient programming recognizes guild members as authorized
- Armor returns to alcoves and becomes dormant
- Party gains 200 XP as if they defeated the armor (clever solution)

**Insight DC 14**: These guardians weren't meant to attack guild members - the seal is degrading

## Exploration & Discoveries

### Examining the Armor (After combat/deactivation)
- **Investigation DC 12**: Find guild symbol etched inside chest plate
- **History DC 14**: Recognize craftsmanship as centuries old, contemporary with Sophia's era

- "Turn back..."
- "Do not undo what was done..."
- "She suffers..."

### Visions (Wisdom Save DC 12, once per session)
