## DM Notes

**Moral Complexity**: Not evil, but dangerously curious. Scientists without ethics. Can be reasoned with if shown consequences.

**Plot Uses**:
- **Antagonists**: Experiments threaten seal
- **Complicated Allies**: Tech helps but methods questionable
- **Discovery**: Research reveals Sophia's truth
- **Redemption Arc**: Kellian helps fix what he broke

**Kellian vs Vera**: Kellian obsessed, Vera has conscience. She may betray Circle to help party stop disaster.

**Big Bad Connection**: Some agents infiltrated Circle, pushing dangerous research. Kellian doesn't know he's being manipulated.
