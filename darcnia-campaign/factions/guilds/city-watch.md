- Add tension (party wanted?)
- Investigate party's activities
- Neutral arbiters in disputes

**As Allies**:

- Share intelligence
- Legal authority/legitimacy
- Represent law and order

**As Complications**:
- Arrest party members
- Investigate party's crimes
- Get in way of shady operations
- Force moral choices (turn in friend?)

### Character Dynamics
- **Mira**: Stern but fair, respects honor, pragmatic
- **Garrick**: By-the-book, less flexible, potential corruption
- **Thane**: Brilliant detective, follows evidence, dogged pursuit

### Moral Complexity
- Law isn't always justice
- Sometimes must break rules for greater good
- Pressure to enforce unjust laws
- Corruption temptation vs duty
- When do you choose order over truth?

### The Sophia Investigation
- Thane may uncover truth independently
- Party must decide: help or hinder investigation?
- Watch learning truth changes everything
