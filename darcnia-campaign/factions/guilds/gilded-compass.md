## Secrets & Hooks

### What Guild Knows (Archive Knowledge)

- Documented multiple sealed doors that match "age" of seal
- Noted "impossible geometry" in certain dungeon areas
- Maps show dungeon expanding slowly over time (seal weakening?)
- Hidden passages leading toward central chamber (Heartstone)

### What Sira Suspects
- Dungeon is artificially constructed, not natural
- Sealed doors placed deliberately in pattern
- Something important at dungeon's center
- Guild Crystalia knows more than they share
- Exploration may be dangerous beyond physical threats

### Secret Maps (Hidden in Archive)
- **Path to Heartstone**: Incomplete but exists
- **Sophia's Route**: Map matching her original descent
- **Seal Pattern**: Layout shows magical sigil shape
- **Safe Zones**: Areas that never change or spawn monsters

### Plot Hooks
- **The Complete Map**: Party hired to finish mapping dungeon
- **Stolen Secrets**: Shadowweave steals Heartstone route map
- **Archaeological Discovery**: Old maps reveal Sophia's path
- **Tragic Accident**: Surveyor unseals chamber, releases danger
- **Alliance**: Compass knowledge crucial to reaching Sophia
