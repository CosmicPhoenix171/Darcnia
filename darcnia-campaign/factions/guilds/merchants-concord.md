## DM Notes

**Moral Ambiguity**: Not evil, just greedy. Can be reasoned with profit motive. Represent capitalism's darker side.

**Plot Uses**: Economic pressure on Crystalia, funding for party, price manipulation creates problems, potential allies if profit aligned.

**Verin's Angle**: Wants to commercialize resurrection magic. Doesn't understand he'd kill Sophia faster. When truth revealed, might actually help (bad for business if city falls).
