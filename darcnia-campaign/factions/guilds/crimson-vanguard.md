## DM Notes

### Using the Vanguard

**As Rivals**:
- Create tension with Guild Crystalia
- Steal party's contracts/glory
- Challenge party to prove themselves
- Pressure to "pick a side" in guild politics

**As Allies**:
- Provide combat backup
- Share tactical knowledge
- Respect earned through strength
- Bridge between old and new guilds

**As Antagonists**:
- Hostile takeover of Crystalia
- Unwitting pawns of Big Bad
- Corrupt tournament or contracts
- Force party into moral compromises

### Character Dynamics
- Thalia: Respect martial PCs, dismissive of pure spellcasters
- Korvan: Harsh but secretly proud when party succeeds
- Rhea: Voice of reason, potential ally if party earns trust

### Moral Complexity
- Not evil, just ruthlessly ambitious
- Can be honorable if challenged correctly
- May become allies against true threat
- Represent progress vs. tradition conflict
