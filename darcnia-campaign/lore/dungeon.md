# Dungeon Notes – The Layered Seal

Maps, seals, and dungeon-level lore.

## Overview – The Prison Disguised as a Trial

The dungeon beneath Solspire is **not a trial to be conquered**. It is a **layered lock**, and each floor is a layer of the seal holding back an ancient evil.

### Dungeon Entrance & Access
- **Location**: The dungeon entrance is in the middle of Solspire, accessible only to authorized guild members
- **Access control**: Guild-sanctioned parties only; enforced by magical wards and city guards
- **Path**: The dungeon descends deep beneath the city, with its lowest levels reaching toward the Heartstone beneath Guild Crystalia
- **Public belief**: The entrance is seen as a gateway to glory and the promised "wish at the end"

### The Truth About the Dungeon
- **Every floor is a layer of the seal** — clearing a floor weakens Sophia's prison
- **The dungeon is a lock** — adventurers are unknowingly dismantling it
- **The "wish" is a lie** — planted by the Big Bad to lure adventurers deeper
- The dungeon's rewards are real (loot, XP, gear) but serve only to encourage further delving
- **The final floor is Sophia's last line of defense** — not a treasure vault

### Tone & Atmosphere
- Ancient stone corridors carved with celestial runes and warnings (mostly faded or misunderstood)
- Traps and puzzles designed not to kill, but to test — or delay
- Sentient stone guardians that react to guild crest tattoos
- Corrupted fauna and twisted magic leaking from the seal's cracks
- Whispers, visions, and dreams of a silver-haired woman as adventurers descend deeper

## The Levels

### Level 1: Entrance Halls
- **Theme**: Introductory challenges, minor guardians, environmental puzzles
- **Guardian type**: Animated stone sentries, minor elementals
- **Seal integrity**: Mostly intact; minimal leakage of dark energy
- **Loot**: Basic enchanted gear, minor potions, old scrolls with fragmented warnings
- **Clues**: Carvings of a woman with outstretched arms; runes that glow when guild tattoos are nearby

### Level 2: Sealed Chambers
- **Theme**: Warded corridors, rune-locks, memory puzzles
- **Guardian type**: Spectral echoes of ancient mages, warded doors that test intent
- **Seal integrity**: Small cracks visible in walls; faint whispers audible in quiet moments
- **Loot**: Intermediate gear, arcane focuses, fragments of Sophia's original journals
- **Clues**: References to "the first guild master" and "the sacrifice that holds the sky"

### Level 3-X: Deepening Descent
- **Theme**: [Placeholder — add custom floors as needed]
- Each floor should:
  - Increase in difficulty and atmosphere
  - Show more visible cracks in the seal
  - Include more direct visions or communication attempts from Sophia
  - Reveal more of the truth through environmental storytelling

### Final Floor: Sophia's Last Stand
- **Theme**: The chamber of the Heartstone itself
- **What lies here**: Sophia, frozen in eternal focus, holding the seal
- **Guardian**: The Heartstone's defenses — possibly celestial constructs, or Sophia's own projected will
- **The Truth Revealed**: No wish. No treasure. Only Sophia's prison and the sealed evil below.
- **Choice**: Do the adventurers attempt to break the final seal, or find another way?

## Seals & Sigils

### Seal 1: The Outer Ward
- Location: Entrance to Level 1
- Description: A massive circular rune carved into the floor, glowing faintly with starlight
- Mechanic: Weakens slightly each time a party enters the dungeon
- Bypass method: None — it is passive and tied to Sophia's will

### Seal 2: The Memory Lock
- Location: Between Level 1 and Level 2
- Description: A door inscribed with celestial glyphs; requires the "memory" of Sophia's sacrifice to open
- Mechanic: Parties may unknowingly open it by solving puzzles that replay fragments of her final battle
- Bypass method: Brute force (but this causes additional damage to the seal)

### Seal X: [Placeholder]
- Add additional seals as floors are designed
- Each seal should require something from the party: a choice, a memory, a sacrifice, a truth

## Myths & Warnings

### Old Tales About the Dungeon's Creator
- "The dungeon was built by a hero to protect the world."
- "A woman of silver hair sealed herself away so that darkness would never rise."
- "The stars themselves wept when the continent rose into the sky."

### Local Superstitions and Tavern Rumors
- "If you dream of a woman in the dungeon, turn back — you're being warned."
- "The deeper you go, the more the dungeon watches you."
- "They say the guild hall sits on top of a fallen god's tomb."
- "Some adventurers who die in the dungeon come back… different."

### Warnings Carved in the Dungeon Walls (Faded, Mostly Ignored)
- "Turn back, lest you undo what was done."
- "She holds the line. Do not cross it."
- "The wish you seek is a lie. The truth you find will break you."

## Notes for the DM

- **Pacing**: Reveal the truth gradually — don't drop it all at once
- **Clues**: Use environmental storytelling, NPC dreams, ancient texts, and Sophia's telepathic whispers
- **Moral tension**: Make the party question whether they should continue or stop
- **Consequences**: Every cleared floor should have a subtle cost (strange dreams, Sophia's voice weakening, visible cracks in the Heartstone)
- **Maps**: Add custom maps for each level as designed
- **Encounter ideas**: Guardians that hesitate when they see guild tattoos; puzzles that test the party's knowledge of Sophia's story
- **Loot balance**: Reward progress, but make the rewards feel hollow once the truth is known
