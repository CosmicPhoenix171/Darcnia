# Guilds of Solspire

Notes on major guilds, starting with Guild Crystalia.

## Guild Crystalia – Guardians Built on Forgotten Ground

Guild Crystalia is one of the oldest guilds in Darcnia, originally founded by **Sophia herself** as a way to gather and train heroes strong enough to protect the world from magical threats.

**But after Sophia's sacrifice, the guild's memory of her faded** — erased through time, corruption, and deliberate manipulation by the sealed evil.

### Founding & Original Purpose
- Founded by Sophia before her sacrifice
- Original purpose: Gather and train heroes to protect the world from magical threats
- Built directly on top of the Heartstone to serve as the final guardian of the seal
- The guild's structure and wards were designed to protect the seal and monitor the dungeon
- Guild Crystalia (along with other guilds) controls access to the dungeon entrance in the city center

### Current State
Now, Crystalia is seen as an **underrated, underfunded, borderline obsolete guild**, living in the shadow of more glamorous or politically connected organizations.

**Ironically, it sits directly on top of the Heartstone, its very structure built to protect the seal.**

- Headquarters: Guild Hall built directly above the Heartstone, with deep basement levels descending toward the seal
- Reputation: Mid-tier guild, seen as outdated or past its prime
- Funding: Limited compared to newer or more politically connected guilds
- Membership: Loyal but small; many members sense something is "off" but can't articulate it

### The Resurrection System – Sophia's Hidden Cost

The guild's resurrection system is treated as **"old magic from the continent's founding,"** and none of its current leadership knows the truth — though some suspect something isn't right.

**The truth:**
- Every resurrection draws directly from Sophia's sealing magic
- Her soul fuels the system
- Each use subtly drains her strength and weakens the seal
- The system is tied to the Guild Crest Tattoo (see below)

### Strange Occurrences (The Seal Weakening)
Recent reports from guild members include:
- Strange occurrences in the basement chambers
- Dreams of a silver-haired woman reaching out
- Feelings of being watched in the deep chambers beneath the guild hall
- Faint whispers in quiet moments, especially near the lower levels
- Guild crest tattoos occasionally glowing or pulsing without activation

**Some whisper the seal is weakening. Some deny anything is wrong at all. And others... have been helping it break.**

### Notable Members
- **Eldon Thorne** (Guild Master) — Old, eccentric, sharp-minded; senses something is wrong but doesn't know what
- **Lyra Windfern** (Receptionist) — Warm, excitable, helpful; collects rumors and may have heard fragments of the truth
- **Sophia** (Original Guild Master) — Sealed in the Heartstone; memory mostly erased from guild records

### Goals & Current Conflicts
- **Public goal**: Train adventurers, provide support for dungeon delvers, maintain the guild's reputation
- **Hidden goal (unknown to most)**: Protect the seal and monitor the Heartstone (though this purpose has been forgotten)
- **Conflicts**:
  - Funding struggles and declining reputation
  - Internal confusion about strange occurrences
  - Possible infiltration by agents of the Big Bad seeking to accelerate the seal's breakdown

### Guild Crest Tattoo (Wondrous Item)

**Type:** Wondrous item (tattoo), rare — requires attunement by a creature inducted into the guild

**Description:**
This magical tattoo is granted to members of Guild Crystalia upon formal initiation. The design is unique to each bearer — often stylized as a flame, rune, or geometric pattern — and glows faintly when activated. Once attuned, the tattoo binds the creature's essence to the Guild's Heartstone, allowing for communication and transportation between members and the Guild Hall itself.

The tattoo is inscribed using arcane ink infused with leyline essence and cannot be removed by non-magical means. The tattoo is considered worn and visible or hidden at the wearer's discretion.

#### Magical Abilities

While attuned to this tattoo, you gain the following magical benefits:

**Return to the Guild Hall** (1/long rest)
- Action: Teleport yourself and gear to a designated teleportation circle within the Guild Hall
- Fails if in an area that prevents planar travel or teleportation (e.g., *antimagic field*, *dimensional lock*)

**Teleport to Ally** (1/day, recharges at dawn)
- Ritual (1 minute): Teleport to another guild member you are familiar with
- Requirements: Target must be on the same plane, willing or unconscious; you must possess a token linked to them (shared sigil, personal item, or their name inscribed on your tattoo)

**Crest Pulse** (1/short rest, bonus action)
- Send a magical "pulse" to all other guild members
- Recipients receive: brief mental image of your location, sense of emotional state, vague sense of physical condition (healthy, injured, critical)
- Can be muted while maintaining attunement

**Emergency Recall** (1/long rest)
- Trigger: When reduced to 0 hit points, may activate as a reaction
- Effect: Immediately teleport to a safe chamber in the Guild Hall (e.g., medical ward, Heartstone sanctuary)
- Cost: Stabilized at 0 HP but gain 1 level of exhaustion

#### Tattoo Lore & Hidden Truth

**Public knowledge:**
The Guild Crest Tattoo is woven with threads of ancient ley magic. It is bound to the Heartstone, a sentient crystal deep beneath the Guild Hall. Through this bond, members remain tethered not only to each other, but to the very heart of Darcnia itself.

**Hidden truth:**
- The tattoos draw power directly from Sophia's sealing magic
- Every use of the tattoo's abilities (especially resurrection via Emergency Recall) drains Sophia's strength
- The tattoos are described in ancient guild lore as "threads of Sophia's protective will woven into the guild's leylines"
- **Should the Heartstone be destroyed or corrupted, all tattoos cease to function**

## Guild Politics

### Alliances, Rivalries, and Recent Incidents
- Crystalia is increasingly isolated due to declining reputation and funding
- Other guilds view Crystalia as a relic of a bygone era
- Some guilds (possibly infiltrated by the Big Bad's agents) actively undermine Crystalia
- Rumors circulate about "strange happenings" at the Crystalia guild hall
- Possible plot hook: A rival guild offers to "help" Crystalia modernize — but their true goal is to gain access to the Heartstone

## Notes for the DM
- Add NPC contacts, hooks, and quest hooks for each guild as the campaign develops
- Consider which guilds might be unknowingly (or knowingly) helping the Big Bad
- Guild politics can provide social encounters, intrigue, and moral dilemmas
- Crystalia's declining state makes it vulnerable to manipulation
