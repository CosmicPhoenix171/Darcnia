# World: Darcnia

## Darcnia – The Floating Continent of Trials and Secrets

Darcnia is a vast, floating continent suspended in the cosmos above the Material Plane. It is a place of ancient magic, forgotten history, and living myth. Adventurers from all realms journey to Darcnia in search of glory, truth, and the whispered promise that those who conquer the dungeon at its heart may have their deepest wish granted.

**But Darcnia was never meant to be explored — it is not a blessing. It is a prison.**

**And the key to that prison… is a woman named Sophia.**

### Geography & Tone
- A floating continent suspended in cosmic space, anchored by the Heartstone's magic
- Created by the energy of Sophia's final spell during the ancient sealing ritual
- Atmosphere: ancient magic, forgotten history, living myth, cosmic beauty hiding dark secrets
- Important cities: Solspire (capital), others [to be detailed]
- Power centers: guilds (especially Guild Crystalia), temples, mysterious orders

## Solspire – The City Above the Abyss

Solspire is the capital city of Darcnia, the shining beacon atop the floating continent. It spirals outward in graceful tiers, dotted with magical architecture, glowing leyline veins, and hovering skybridges. Solspire is seen by the world as a city of enlightenment, honor, and adventure.

**But that is a carefully constructed lie.**

The city is built directly atop the final seal of an ancient evil. That seal is the Heartstone, and its prison is Sophia — the original guild master of Crystalia. Her story has been lost to time, and twisted further by the hand of the great evil she sealed away.

### City Features
- Architecture: Graceful tiers, magical architecture, glowing leyline veins, hovering skybridges
- Key locations: 
  - Guild Crystalia (built above the Heartstone)
  - Heart Plaza (city center)
  - The Dungeon Entrance (middle of the city, guild-access only)
  - Market, docks, other guild halls
  - Deep chambers beneath Guild Crystalia descending to the Heartstone
- Public perception: City of enlightenment, honor, and adventure
- Hidden truth: Built directly atop the Heartstone seal; the entire city is part of Sophia's prison

### Current Situation
- Strange occurrences in basement chambers beneath Guild Crystalia
- Dreams of a silver-haired woman reported by some guild members
- Feelings of being watched in deep chambers
- The seal is weakening — the Heartstone is cracking

## The Heartstone – Sophia's Eternal Sacrifice

Buried beneath Guild Crystalia, far below its lowest levels and hidden by arcane barriers, lies the **Heartstone** — a towering monolith of cosmic quartz, transparent yet indestructible, glowing with starlight from within.

### Sophia's Prison

Encased within the Heartstone is **Sophia**, the first guild master of Crystalia, who sacrificed herself to stop an ancient evil from consuming the world.

**She is not resting.**

Sophia is frozen in the act of her final, godlike spell:
- **Arms outstretched**: one hand raised toward the stars to channel celestial magic, the other pressed down toward the depths to seal the darkness below
- **Long silver-white hair** floats behind her, caught mid-burst like a comet's tail
- **Robes suspended in motion**, embroidered with runes, constellations, and arcane symbols of ancient planes
- **Eyes open** — glowing faintly with sheer willpower, locked on the enemy she sacrificed everything to hold at bay
- **Runes spiral** along her arms and fingertips, charged with ancient magic
- **Frozen arcs of lightning** shimmer inside the crystal, relics of the moment when she bound the spell that reshaped the world

### The Truth About the Seal

Sophia knew what she was doing. She knew this spell would not only imprison the evil — it would trap her inside the Heartstone forever, turning her into the anchor that keeps the seal from unraveling.

- **Her body is the lock.**
- **Her will is the ward.**
- **The Heartstone is her prison.**

**And it is cracking.**

### The Resurrection System – A Slow Undoing

When adventurers join Guild Crystalia, they are marked with a **Guild Crest Tattoo** — a magical brand that allows them to resurrect upon death, reappearing at the summoning circle in the guild or the nearest safe zone.

**This isn't a gift. It isn't a spell.**

- Every resurrection draws directly from Sophia's sealing magic
- Her soul is what fuels the system
- Each use subtly drains her strength
- Every adventurer's death chips away at her will
- Each dungeon cleared, each death reversed, is one step closer to releasing what she fought so hard to contain

**And most of the world has no idea.**

### Connected Items
The **Guild Crest Tattoo** — a rare, attunable wondrous tattoo granted to inducted members of Guild Crystalia. The tattoo binds a member's essence to the Heartstone and grants limited teleportation, emergency recall, and a short-range mental "pulse" to other guild members. Its power fails if the Heartstone is destroyed or corrupted.

## The Big Bad – The Sealed Evil

### The Lie of the Dungeon – A Wish at the End

There is a common belief among all adventurers who come to Darcnia:
**"If you reach the bottom of the dungeon, you'll be granted a wish."**

That belief is a fabrication. A clever manipulation planted by the Big Bad — the very entity sealed beneath the Heartstone. Over generations, it has subtly influenced churches, historians, adventurers, and even other guilds, spreading the myth to keep a constant stream of souls feeding into the dungeon.

**Why?**

Because every floor of the dungeon is a layer of the seal.

- The dungeon is not a trial to be conquered, but a **lock**
- Every adventurer who reaches deeper peels that lock open
- The promise of a wish is **bait**
- The dungeon's rewards are real only in the short term
- In the end, the adventurers are the ones who will set the evil free

**And the final floor?**
It isn't a treasure vault — **it's Sophia's last line of defense.**

### Nature & Motivation
- Name/title: [To be revealed]
- Ancient evil sealed by Sophia's sacrifice
- Manipulates churches, historians, and adventurers through subtle influence
- Goal: Break the seal by having adventurers unknowingly dismantle it floor by floor
- Connection to Heartstone: Directly sealed beneath it; Sophia is the anchor holding it in place

## Common (False) Beliefs vs. Hidden Truth

### What the World Believes (Lies)
- "The Heartstone is just a naturally occurring magical crystal from the Age of Ascension."
- "Sophia was a myth, or at best an ancient explorer who vanished."
- "The city of Solspire rose into the sky thanks to a celestial event guided by the gods."
- "If you clear the dungeon, you will be granted your heart's desire."
- "Crystalia is just another mid-tier adventurer guild with nothing special left."

### The Truth Hidden Beneath
- Solspire was created by the energy of Sophia's final spell — the blast lifted the region into the sky, creating Darcnia and anchoring it around the Heartstone
- Sophia is not dead — she is conscious, locked in an eternal state of focus, holding the seal together
- The dungeon beneath Solspire is the layered cage meant to contain the Big Bad — and clearing it undoes the spell
- The "wish" at the end is a lie. What lies at the bottom… is freedom for the evil, and death for Sophia
- The resurrection system used by Crystalia and its guild crest tattoos is powered by Sophia's will, and every use weakens her
- The Heartstone is cracking — both figuratively and literally

## Notes for the DM
- Slowly reveal the truth through dreams, visions, ancient texts, and NPC warnings
- The party may unknowingly contribute to weakening the seal by using resurrection or clearing dungeon floors
- Moral dilemma: Do they stop adventuring to preserve Sophia's prison, or find another way?
- Sophia may be able to communicate telepathically as the seal weakens
- Consider: What happens if the party learns the truth before reaching the final floor?
