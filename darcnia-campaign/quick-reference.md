## Campaign Themes to Emphasize

1. **Moral Dilemma**: The quest itself is the problem
2. **Tragic Heroism**: Sophia's sacrifice
3. **Hidden Truth**: Heroes may be unwitting villains
4. **Cost of Power**: Resurrection has a price
5. **Choice Matters**: Multiple solutions to final conflict

**Remember**: The goal is for players to uncover the truth gradually and face the moral choice: preserve the seal at Sophia's expense, or risk everything to save her?
