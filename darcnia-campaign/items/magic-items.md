# Magic Items & Artifacts

Campaign-specific magic items for the Darcnia campaign.

## Guild Crest Tattoo
*Wondrous item (tattoo), rare (requires attunement by inducted guild member)*

**Full description**: See `lore/guilds.md`

**Quick Reference**:
- Return to Guild Hall (1/long rest, action)
- Teleport to Ally (1/day at dawn, 1 min ritual)
- Crest Pulse (1/short rest, bonus action)
- Emergency Recall (when reduced to 0 HP, 1/long rest)

**Hidden Cost**: Each use drains Sophia's strength slightly.

## Sophia's Tear
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

A crystalline pendant that shimmers with inner starlight. Found in deep dungeon levels or as reward for helping Sophia.

**Properties**:
- **Heartstone Connection**: While attuned, you can sense the direction and approximate distance to the Heartstone.
- **Sophia's Whisper**: Once per long rest, you can cast *sending* to communicate with Sophia (she can respond with 25 words of whispered emotion/images rather than coherent speech).
- **Sacrifice's Strength**: When you drop to 0 hit points while wearing this, you can choose to stabilize yourself automatically. If you do, the pendant cracks and loses its magic for 24 hours.
- **Lore Attunement**: While attuned, you have advantage on Intelligence checks related to the Heartstone, Sophia, or the sealing ritual.

**Curse**: The wearer experiences vivid dreams of Sophia's final battle. Each long rest, make a DC 10 Wisdom save or wake with 1 level of exhaustion (removable as normal).

## Seal Fragment
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

A fist-sized piece of crystalline stone that pulses with faint blue light. Found when dungeon seals are broken.

**Properties**:
- Can be used as an arcane focus
- Sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius
- **Seal Sense**: Glows brighter when near other seals or the Heartstone (within 100 feet)
- **One-Time Use**: Can be consumed to cast *dispel magic* at 5th level (DC 15). The fragment shatters after use.

**Lore**: Each fragment represents a piece of Sophia's sealing magic. Collecting them weakens the overall seal but may provide power needed to save Sophia later.

**DM Note**: Award 1-2 per dungeon level cleared. Create moral dilemma: use power now or save fragments?

## Starlight Blade
*Weapon (longsword), rare (requires attunement)*

A silvery blade that glimmers like starlight. Forged by Sophia herself for her elite guardians.

**Properties**:
- **Magic Weapon**: +1 to attack and damage rolls
- **Starfire**: As a bonus action, you can cause the blade to emit bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light lasts until you use a bonus action to extinguish it.
- **Celestial Strike**: Once per short rest, when you hit a fiend or undead with this weapon, you deal an extra 2d8 radiant damage.
- **Guardian's Bond**: While wielding this blade within 60 feet of the Heartstone or a seal, you gain +2 AC.

**Lore**: Only a handful of these blades still exist. Guild Crystalia would pay handsomely for its return, or it could be kept as a symbol of Sophia's legacy.

---

## Leyline Compass
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

A small crystal disc etched with arcane symbols. The needle spins unless near ley line nexuses.

**Properties**:
- **Ley Line Detection**: The needle points toward the nearest major ley line nexus (such as the Heartstone) within 1 mile.
- **Magical Navigation**: You have advantage on Survival checks to navigate in dungeons or magically warded areas.
- **Energy Sense**: The compass vibrates when you are within 30 feet of strong magic (8th level spell or higher, or powerful magic items).

**Lore**: Created by the Arkwright Circle to study Solspire's ley lines. The Circle is very interested in recovering these devices.

## Memory Shard
*Wondrous item, rare*

A palm-sized crystal that swirls with misty images. Contains a fragment of preserved memory.

**Properties**:
- **View Memory**: As an action, you can peer into the shard and experience a 1-minute memory as if you were there (sight and sound only).
- **Share Memory**: You can touch another creature and allow them to experience the memory.
- **One Use**: After the memory is viewed 3 times, the shard crumbles to dust.

**Available Memories** (Create or roll):
1. Sophia's final battle (terrifying, inspiring)
2. Guild Crystalia's founding ceremony (joyful, hopeful)
3. The moment Darcnia lifted into the sky (awe-inspiring, chaotic)
4. Sophia sealing herself in the Heartstone (tragic, resolute)
5. The Big Bad's imprisonment (hint at its true nature)
6. A conversation between Sophia and Eldon's predecessor (cryptic warnings)

**Lore**: Found in deep dungeon levels or given as rewards. Provide crucial plot information.

## Warding Talisman
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

A small amulet inscribed with protective runes. Common treasure in upper dungeon levels.

**Properties**:
- **Seal Protection**: You have advantage on saving throws against effects created by dungeon seals or wards.
- **Guardian Recognition**: Animated armor and similar construct guardians are less likely to attack you (DM's discretion, or they attack last in initiative).
- **Limited Charges**: The talisman has 3 charges. You can expend 1 charge as a reaction when you fail a saving throw to reroll it. The talisman regains 1d3 charges daily at dawn.

**Lore**: Created by early Guild Crystalia members to protect delvers. Ironically, makes it easier to weaken the seal.

---

## Corruption Vial
*Potion, rare*

A dark purple liquid that seems to writhe in its container. Appears in mid-to-late dungeon levels.

**Properties**:
- **Dark Power**: Drinking this potion grants you +2 to all ability scores for 1 hour.
- **Corruption Cost**: At the end of the hour, make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, you gain 1 level of exhaustion and have disadvantage on Wisdom saves for 24 hours.
- **Seal Weakening**: Each vial consumed weakens the seal slightly (track corruption points if desired).

**Lore**: These are manifestations of the Big Bad's leaking influence. Tempting but dangerous.

**DM Note**: Use to create moral dilemma. Power now at cost to Sophia/seal?

## Heartstonne Shard (Artifact Fragment)
*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*

**This should only be found in late-game after major plot developments.**

A jagged piece of cosmic crystal that broke off from the Heartstone itself. Touching it causes visions of Sophia.

**Properties**:
- **Sophia's Voice**: You can communicate with Sophia telepathically at will (she is weakened and can only send brief messages/emotions).
- **Seal Manipulation**: You can cast *glyph of warding* at will without components.
- **Resurrection Echo**: When you would be reduced to 0 HP, the shard can activate your Emergency Recall automatically (no attunement to guild tattoo required). This doesn't cost Sophia's strength.
- **Reality Anchor**: You have advantage on saving throws against effects that would transport you to another plane.

**Curse**: You feel Sophia's pain. Every time someone uses a Guild Crest Tattoo resurrection within 1 mile, you take 1d4 psychic damage.

**Plot Importance**: This shard could be key to freeing Sophia or repairing the seal. Major story item.
