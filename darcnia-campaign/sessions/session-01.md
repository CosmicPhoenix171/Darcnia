# Session 01 — Arrival in Solspire

Summary of events and important beats.

---

## Opening – The Floating Continent

**Setting**: The party arrives in Solspire, the capital city of Darcnia — the floating continent suspended in the cosmos above the Material Plane.

**Initial impressions**:
- Graceful tiers of magical architecture
- Glowing leyline veins running through the streets
- Hovering skybridges connecting districts
- A sense of wonder mixed with something... off
- Rumors of a dungeon beneath the city, and a "wish" at its heart

---

## Guild Contact – Meeting Eldon Thorne and Tessa Windfern

### Arrival at Guild Crystalia
**Setting**: Guild Crystalia's foyer / main hall — slightly worn but welcoming; arcane symbols and old banners adorn the walls.

**Nyra's first meeting with Eldon Thorne**:
- Eldon greets the party personally (unusual for a guild master)
- He is eccentric but kind, offering guidance and a small introductory task
- He mentions the guild's "old magic" and hints that the guild sits on "sacred ground"
- **Tattoo introduction**: Eldon explains the Guild Crest Tattoo — a sign of formal induction and a tether to the Guild Hall via the Heartstone
  - Describes it as "ancient magic" that allows resurrection and communication
  - Does not mention that it drains Sophia's strength (he doesn't know)
- **Possible hook**: Eldon shares a vague story about "the first guild master" — a legendary figure whose name has been lost to time

**Nyra meets Tessa Windfern**:
- Tessa is warm, excitable, and immediately helpful
- She provides:
  - Rumors: "There's a wish at the bottom of the dungeon!" (believes the lie)
  - Directions: Key locations in Solspire (market, taverns, other guilds)
  - Contact details: Merchants, informants, potential allies
- **Possible scene**: Tessa offers tea and shares gossip about recent events in the city

## Key Scenes

### 1. Introductions & Roleplay
- Eldon and Tessa welcome Nyra (and the party) to Guild Crystalia
- Eldon gives a brief tour of the guild hall (avoiding the deep basement levels)
- Tessa provides a starter quest or task to test the party's abilities

### 2. A Minor Task or Investigation
**Possible quest options**:
- Deliver a package to a merchant in the market district
- Investigate a minor disturbance near the docks
- Retrieve a lost item from the upper levels of the dungeon (Level 1 entrance)
- Interview witnesses about strange dreams or occurrences

**Purpose**: Introduce the party to Solspire, build trust with the guild, and hint at larger mysteries.

### 3. Discovery – Rumors About the Heartstone
**Where**: Tavern, market, or guild hall archives

**What the party learns** (surface-level, incomplete):
- The Heartstone is a legendary artifact deep beneath Guild Crystalia
- It is tied to the guild's resurrection system
- The dungeon entrance is in the middle of the city, accessible only to guild-sanctioned adventurers
- The dungeon descends deep beneath Solspire, with rumors that the lowest levels connect to ancient chambers near the Heartstone
- There are "old stories" about a woman who sealed herself away to protect the world
- Some locals claim to have had dreams of a silver-haired woman reaching out

**Hooks for future sessions**:
- Who was the woman in the stories?
- What is the Heartstone, really?
- Why is dungeon access restricted to guilds only?
- Why does the guild's basement feel... wrong?

### 4. Meeting Sophia - The "Eccentric Member"
**Setting**: Guild hall common room, early morning after marking ceremony

**The Scene:**
As the party settles in for breakfast, a **translucent figure** phases through the far wall. She appears to be a woman in her mid-30s, with long silver-white hair that floats as if underwater, wearing robes embroidered with constellations. She's see-through - you can see the wall behind her.

She sits at a corner table, apparently reading a book. The book floats in front of her ethereal hands.

**Eldon Thorne enters, carrying tea:**
- "Ah, morning Sophia. Sleep well?"
- Sophia nods silently but doesn't look up
- Thorne acts as if this is completely normal

**If Party Stares or Asks:**

**Tessa** (cheerfully): "Oh! That's Sophia. She's been with the guild forever. Keeps odd hours, very private. Don't take it personally if she doesn't chat much!"

**If Party Approaches Sophia:**

She looks up, makes direct eye contact with Nyra (and any other marked members). Her eyes seem to look *through* rather than *at*.

**Sophia** (voice slightly echoes): "The mark suits you. It remembers, even when we forget."

Before the party can respond:

**Thorne** (quickly interjecting): "Don't mind her, she's always cryptic before breakfast. Sophia's a bit... eccentric. Brilliant, but eccentric."

**If Touched:** Her form feels like cold mist. She doesn't react negatively, just looks amused.

**Abnisha Appears:**

A spectral cat - shimmering silver and blue - materializes and jumps onto Sophia's lap. Unlike Sophia, the cat feels more *real*, though its fur is cool like flowing water.

**Abnisha** purrs loudly, staring at Nyra specifically.

**Sophia** (stroking the cat): "Abnisha likes you. She has good judgment."

**If Asked About Being a Ghost:**

**Sophia:** "Ghost? No. I'm very much here. Just... differently."

**Thorne** (nervous laugh): "She uses a lot of illusion magic. Makes her look all spooky. Great party trick!"

**Sophia** (ignoring him): "You'll have questions. In time, perhaps I'll have answers."

She stands (passes through her chair) and walks toward the wall. Before she phases through:

**Sophia:** "Good luck on your first delve. The dungeon remembers those who enter. Make sure you remember yourselves."

She vanishes. Abnisha remains, rubbing against party members' legs before also disappearing.

**Aftermath:**

**Thorne** (to party): "Don't mind her. Very old, very powerful, very strange. Been with the guild longer than anyone can remember. Just... treat her like any other member, yeah?"

He's clearly lying about something, but not hostile.

**Tessa:** "She's nice once you get to know her! Bit mysterious, but she's helped me lots of times. I think she's lonely."

## Investigation Hooks

### Sophia-Related Clues:

1. **Ask about Sophia:**
   - Tessa: "Been here forever! I don't know where she sleeps though. Never seen her quarters."
   - Thorne: "She's... complicated. Best not to pry."
   - Other members: "Sophia? Yeah, she's weird. But harmless. I think?"

2. **Research in the Library:**
   - Old records mention "Guildmaster Sophia" from centuries ago
   - Most records about her are missing or redacted
   - A faded portrait shows a woman who looks exactly like the ghost

3. **Follow Abnisha:**
   - The cat appears throughout the day, leading party to interesting places
   - Sometimes sits by sealed doors in the basement
   - Purrs loudly when party discusses the marking ceremony
   - Reacts nervously to mentions of the deep dungeon

4. **Nighttime Encounter:**
   - Sophia manifests in sleeping party members' rooms
   - Whispers through their tattoos: "Be careful in the dark. Not everything down there is what it seems."
   - Vanishes if they wake fully

- Research the Guild Crest Tattoo: how initiation works, tokens needed for Teleport to Ally, and where the Guild Hall's teleportation circle is located

### Character Development
- Nyra's personal goals and motivations (why did she come to Darcnia?)
- Relationships with Eldon and Tessa
- Party dynamics and bonds

### Foreshadowing

- A sense of unease in the guild's basement levels

---

## DM Notes for Session 01

### Tone & Pacing
- Start with wonder and excitement (the floating city, the guild, the promise of adventure)
- Gradually introduce unease and mystery (whispers, dreams, incomplete stories)
- End on a hook: a clear next step (explore the dungeon, investigate the Heartstone, etc.)

### Secrets to Keep Hidden
- Do not reveal the truth about Sophia, the seal, or the dungeon's true purpose yet
- Let the party believe the "wish at the end" story for now
- Foreshadow subtly through dreams, environmental details, and NPC hints

### Possible Complications
- A rival guild member makes a snide remark about Crystalia being "past its prime"
- Strange noises or a faint glow from the basement levels
- A local warns the party: "If you dream of a woman in silver, turn back"
