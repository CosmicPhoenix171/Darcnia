# Quest: Shadows in the Basement

**Requester**: Eldon Thorne (Guild Master)  
**Location**: Guild Crystalia  
**Reward**: 50 gp + Sending Stone  
**Difficulty**: Medium  
**Type**: Investigation, skill challenge, optional combat

---

## Quest Hook

Eldon pulls the party aside with unusual seriousness.

**Boxed Text**:
> "I need to speak with you privately. Come to my office."
>
> Once inside, he closes the door and leans heavily on his staff.
>
> "There's been... occurrences. Strange sounds from the lower archives. Guild members reporting dreams - always the same: a silver-haired woman reaching out, pleading. Some wake in tears. I've been having them too.
>
> I'm old enough to know when something isn't right. The basement has always been quiet, almost too quiet. But now? Now it feels... alive. Aware. I need someone I can trust to investigate. Will you help?"

---

## Objectives

1. Investigate Basement Level 1 (storage area)
2. Access Basement Level 2 (requires Eldon's key or lockpicking)
3. Discover the source of the whispers
4. Find clues about Sophia and the Heartstone
5. Report findings to Eldon

**Optional**: Avoid or defeat spectral guardians if seal is triggered

---

## Investigation Details

**Full encounter details**: See `encounters/guild-basement-investigation.md`

### Key Discoveries

1. **Sophia's Portrait**
   - Hidden in Level 2 archives
   - Confirms she was real, not just legend
   - Nameplate partially erased

2. **Ancient Journal Fragment**
   - First-person account of Sophia's sacrifice
   - Mentions "sealing myself as the anchor"
   - Handout available

3. **Sealed Crystalline Door**
   - Warm, pulsing with light
   - Leads down toward Heartstone
   - Cannot be opened yet (future quest)

4. **Whispers in Celestial**
   - "Stop..." "Turn back..." "Do not undo..."
   - Party may not understand language but feels emotion

---

## Complications

### Skill Challenge
**Complexity**: 3 successes before 2 failures (DC 13)

**Success**: Discover sealed door and learn about Sophia without combat

**Failure**: Trigger protective wards, summon 2-3 Shadows (see encounter file)

### Combat (If Triggered)
- **Enemies**: 2-3 Shadows
- **Terrain**: Archives with cover from shelves
- **Special**: Shadows aren't truly hostile - they're confused echoes of protection magic
- **Can be avoided**: With high Arcana or Religion checks

---

## Reporting to Eldon

### Eldon's Reaction

**Boxed Text**:
> Eldon listens intently to your report, his expression growing more troubled with each word. When you finish, he's silent for a long moment.
>
> "I feared as much. I've suspected for years that the guild sits on something... significant. But seeing proof?" He shakes his head. "Sophia. The first guild master. The texts say she vanished mysteriously, but this..." He taps the journal fragment. "This suggests something far more profound. And troubling.
>
> That sealed door worries me most. If the seal is weakening, as you describe, then whatever Sophia was holding back may not stay contained forever."

### Information Eldon Shares

- Sophia founded Guild Crystalia centuries ago
- She was legendary mage and protector
- Records of her mysteriously incomplete or erased
- The guild's "old magic" (resurrection system) dates back to her era
- Eldon's predecessor hinted at "great secrets beneath the hall"
- The Heartstone legend is connected to her somehow

### Eldon's Request

**Boxed Text**:
> "I cannot ask you to do more without understanding what we're facing. But I sense this is only the beginning. If you're willing, I'd like you to research what you can about Sophia and the Heartstone. Check the city archives, speak to the old sages. Learn what happened to her - and what might happen to us all if that seal breaks.
>
> In the meantime, I'll petition the Guild Council for access to restricted records. And..." He reaches into his desk. "Take this. It's attuned to mine. If you discover anything urgent, we can communicate immediately."
>
> He hands you a Sending Stone, warm in your palm.

---

## Consequences & Ripples

### Immediate
- Other guild members notice party going to basement
- Rumors spread about "secret mission for Eldon"
- Lyra asks party about findings (can share or keep secret)

### Campaign-Level
- First major step toward uncovering the truth
- Party now aware Sophia is real and connected to the guild
- Sets up later revelation about resurrection system
- Establishes Heartstone as major plot element

---

## DM Notes

- This is the campaign's first major plot quest
- Pace revelations carefully - don't dump all secrets at once
- Eldon's trust in party is significant
- Use this to transition from "typical adventuring" to "world-shattering conspiracy"
- Party should leave with more questions than answers
- Sophia's journal should be emotionally impactful (read aloud slowly)

---

## Variations

**If Party Refuses**:
- Eldon is disappointed but understanding
- Quest remains available
- Strange occurrences escalate (forced eventually)

**If Party Reveals Findings Publicly**:
- Causes guild controversy
- Other factions become interested
- Complicates future investigations

**If Party Tries to Open Sealed Door Now**:
- Impossible without key or high-level magic
- Attempting triggers stronger wards (harder combat)
- Eldon warns against forcing it
