## Description

**Boxed Text**:
> "Please, you must help me! My dear Mr. Whiskers hasn't come home in three days. He's an orange tabby with a white chest and the most lovely green eyes. I last saw him near the market - he loves to chase the pigeons. He's all I have left since my husband passed. I'll pay whatever I can!"

---

## Investigation Phase

### Gathering Information

**Talk to Locals** (Persuasion DC 10):
- Old Mira (vendor): "Saw an orange cat on the rooftops yesterday, heading toward the old temple district."
- Street urchin: "I'll tell you for 1 silver!" (Pays off: "Cat's been hanging around the roof near Goldsmith Street.")
- Guard: "Yeah, I've seen it. Refuses to come down. Tried to help but couldn't reach it."

### Tracking the Cat

**Survival/Investigation DC 12**:
- Follow paw prints and disturbed pigeon feathers
- Trail leads to three-story building near market
- Cat visible on roof (60 feet up)

---

## The Rescue

### Getting to the Roof

**Options**:
1. **Climb** (Athletics DC 13):
   - Building has handholds, balconies
   - Failure: Fall 10 ft. to balcony (1d6 bludgeoning), retry from there
   
2. **Persuade Building Owner** (Persuasion DC 11):
   - Allows access to internal stairs
   - Much easier but takes 10 minutes of negotiation

3. **Magic** (Feather Fall, Fly, Levitate, etc.):
   - Automatic success
   - Mrs. Halloway very impressed

### Catching Mr. Whiskers

**Animal Handling DC 12**:
- Success: Cat comes willingly, purrs
- Failure: Cat hisses and runs to far edge of roof (second attempt at DC 10)
- Critical Failure (nat 1): Cat jumps to adjacent building (chase scene!)

**Alternative - Bait** (no check):
- Fish or meat from market (costs 5 cp)
- Cat approaches and can be picked up

---

## The Twist (Optional)

**Arcana DC 15 or Passive Perception 16**:
- Cat's eyes flash with unnatural intelligence
- Faint magical aura around collar

**If Investigated Further**:
Mr. Whiskers is actually a **Tressym** (winged cat) with invisibly retracted wings, or a polymorphed fey creature. He was:
- Scouting Solspire for his fey patron
- Got distracted by pigeons (even fey creatures have instincts)
- Will return to Mrs. Halloway if asked, but may visit party later as ally/contact

**If Players Don't Notice**: 
- Just a normal (if unusually smart) cat
- No mechanical difference

---

## Resolution

### Returning Mr. Whiskers

Mrs. Halloway is overjoyed:
> "Oh, thank you! Thank you! You wonderful people! Here, take this - and please, have some fresh cookies. They're still warm!"

**Rewards**:
- 10 gp as promised
- Dozen fresh cookies (restore 1d4 HP each when eaten, 12 total)
- Mrs. Halloway's eternal gratitude

### Consequences

- **Reputation**: +1 with Solspire civilians (kindness noted)
- **Contact**: Mrs. Halloway will bake for party anytime (cheap rations source)
- **Future Hook**: If Mr. Whiskers is fey, may return with message or quest
- **Word Spreads**: Other civilians may ask for help with minor issues

---

## Complications (Optional)

Roll 1d6 if you want to add complexity:

1. **Rival Adventurers**: Another party is also after the cat (for reward), race to rescue
2. **Actual Danger**: Cat is being stalked by hawk/aerial predator
3. **Property Damage**: Climbing damages merchant's awning (must pay 5 gp or talk way out)
4. **Wrong Cat**: First cat found is similar but not Mr. Whiskers (must search further)
5. **Cat Thief**: Someone stole Mr. Whiskers planning to ransom him (investigation becomes chase)
6. **Fey Complication**: If cat is fey, his patron wants him back (social encounter with sprite/pixie)
