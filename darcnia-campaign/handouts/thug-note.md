```
Meet at usual spot, third bell.
New shipment from below.
Boss says "market's ripe" - guild types 
everywhere. Easy marks with those fancy tattoos.

Watch for the silver-hairs if you go deep.
Davrik swears he saw one in his dreams.
Got spooked and quit.

## DM Notes

**Decoding** (Intelligence DC 10 or Investigation DC 12):
- "Below" = the dungeon
- "Silver-hairs" = possibly referring to Sophia or her visions
- "Davrik" = local thug who can be found and questioned (see NPCs)

**Implications**:
- Criminal network is active near the dungeon
- Some criminals are having dreams/visions of Sophia
- "New shipment from below" = stolen dungeon loot? Something else?

**Follow-up Hook**: Party can investigate the "usual spot" (an abandoned warehouse in the dock district) or track down Davrik.
