# Handout: Tavern Rumors

*Give these to players when they spend time in taverns or talk to locals. Roll 1d10 or let players choose.*

## 1. The Wish at the Bottom
"Everyone knows if you reach the bottom of the dungeon, you get a wish granted. Any wish! That's why adventurers come from across the planes. I knew a guy who knew a guy who made it to level 5..."

**Truth**: This is the lie planted by the Big Bad. No wish exists.

## 2. The Silver-Haired Woman
"My cousin's a guild member, right? Says he's been having dreams about a woman with silver hair trapped in crystal. Reaches out to him, begging for help. Woke up in a cold sweat. Hasn't been back to the guild hall since."

**Truth**: These are Sophia's attempts to communicate as the seal weakens.

---

## 3. Guild Crystalia's Decline
"Crystalia used to be THE guild, you know? Founded by some legendary hero centuries ago. Now look at 'em - broke, forgotten, living in the past. The Merchant's Concord is where the real power is."

**Truth**: Crystalia's decline is partly due to the Big Bad's manipulation erasing Sophia's memory.

---

## 4. The Resurrection System
"That guild tattoo thing is weird, right? You die, you come back. Convenient, sure, but... doesn't it creep you out? Where does that magic come from? My aunt says it's necromancy."

**Truth**: The resurrection system drains Sophia's power. Characters might start questioning this.

## 5. Strange Sounds from the Deep
"Worked the night shift at Crystalia for a week. Never again. You hear things from the basement. Whispers. Chimes. Once swore I heard someone crying. Old Eldon says it's just the leylines, but..."

**Truth**: The Heartstone and Sophia beneath the guild.

---

## 6. The Dungeon Guards Are Weird
"Those guards at the dungeon entrance? They're not normal city watch. They've got this look in their eyes. Like they're guarding something they don't understand. Asked one about it once. He just said 'We keep people out as much as we keep something in.'"

**Truth**: The guards are uneasy about the dungeon but don't know why.

---

## 7. Other Guilds Act Strange
"Ever notice the Arkwright Circle has been sniffing around Crystalia lately? Offering to 'help modernize' their systems. Suspicious, if you ask me. What do tech-mages want with old magic?"

**Truth**: Some guilds may be infiltrated by the Big Bad's agents.

---

## 8. The Heartstone Glows Brighter
"Used to be a legend - the Heartstone beneath the city. Nobody believed it. But lately? Folks who go deep into the old tunnels say they can see a glow. Pulsing, like a heartbeat. Getting brighter every year."

**Truth**: The Heartstone is cracking; the glow is leaking through seals.

---

## 9. Adventurers Change After the Dungeon
"Know what's creepy? Some adventurers come back from deep levels acting... different. Can't put my finger on it. Like something's following them. Or like they heard something they weren't supposed to."

**Truth**: Deep dungeon levels expose adventurers to the Big Bad's influence or Sophia's desperate warnings.

---

## 10. The City Wasn't Always Floating
"My grandmother's grandmother swore the city was on the ground once. Then one day - BOOM - lifted into the sky. Divine intervention, they said. But the old texts mention a battle, a great sacrifice... Nobody talks about it anymore."

**Truth**: Sophia's spell lifted the region to create Darcnia. The memory has been suppressed.
