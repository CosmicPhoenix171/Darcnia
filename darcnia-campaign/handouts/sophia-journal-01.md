Day Unknown - The Final Preparation

I can no longer count the days. Time loses meaning 
when you know what must be done.

The entity grows stronger. It feeds on fear, on despair,
on the very fabric of our world. My colleagues believe
we can seal it away with conventional magic.

They are wrong.

I have found another way. The celestial texts speak of
an "Eternal Ward" - a spell that requires not just power,
but a willing sacrifice. An anchor. A living lock.

The spell will trap the entity beneath the city. It will
lift this entire region into the sky, beyond the reach of
its corruption. The leylines will be bound to a single point,
a crystal of pure cosmic energy.

And I... I will be that crystal's heart.

I know what this means. I know I will never see another
sunrise. Never laugh with my guild members again. Neverâ€”

[The entry ends abruptly, as if the writer was interrupted]

I pray they will understand. I pray they will remember.
But if they forget... perhaps that is a mercy.

The guild must endure. The world must endure.

I will hold the line.

- Sophia
First Guild Master of Crystalia

## DM Notes

**What This Reveals**:
- Sophia knew exactly what she was doing (voluntary sacrifice)
- The floating continent (Darcnia) was created by her spell
- The Heartstone = Sophia transformed into cosmic crystal
- She hoped to be remembered but expected to be forgotten
- "Hold the line" = maintaining the seal forever

**Player Reactions**: This should be emotionally impactful. Sophia isn't just a legend - she's a real person who made an impossible choice.

**Follow-up**: Other journal fragments can be found deeper in the dungeon or city archives.
