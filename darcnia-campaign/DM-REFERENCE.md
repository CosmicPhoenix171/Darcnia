## Campaign Snapshot
- Premise: New guild recruits uncover a sealed dungeon beneath Heart Plaza. The city’s guild web masks an older truth about the Heartstone and Sophia’s sacrifice.
- Tone: Mystical intrigue, faction politics, dungeon delving with moral costs.
- Core Loop: City lead → faction tug → delve/reveal → cost tracked → consequences surface.
  - Sources: CAMPAIGN-READY.md; quick-reference.md; lore/world.md; lore/dungeon.md

## Canonical Truths (DM Only)
- Sophia bound herself to the Heartstone; her spirit lingers and can awaken through the party’s actions.
- The dungeon is a multilayered seal maintaining city stability; disturbing it weakens protections.
- Resurrection and wish-like power have hidden corruption costs; the Crest Tattoo resonates with these forces.
- Knowledge diffusion increases danger; Arkwright Circle and others will act on leaks.
  - Sources: lore/world.md; lore/dungeon.md; npcs/sophia/lore.md; items/magic-items.md

## Party Anchor
- PC: Nyra Vex — Rogue 1. Hooks: Guild token, sealed Level 3 scroll, heard a whisper during the guild-marking. Strengths: Perception, Stealth, Insight.
  - File: pcs/nyra-vex.md

## Where We Are
- Session 01 recap: Arrival, guild orientation, first skirmish with city thugs, hints about guild basement and Heart Plaza.
  - Source: sessions/session-01.md
- Session 02 (ready-to-run beats):
  1) Heart Plaza scene: rumors, statue, tattoo pulse; set tone.
  2) Dungeon L1 Entrance encounter: Animated Armor; talkdown possible via tattoo resonance.
  3) Guild Basement follow-up: investigation skill challenge; shadow residue.
  4) Handouts: distribute thug note, job board, Sophia journal #1 as needed.
  5) Tease factions: Arkwright interest, City Watch presence.

## Running Next Session (quick script)
- Cold open at Heart Plaza: rumor snippet, statue detail, tattoo tingle.
- Choice: follow thug thread or descend to L1. Offer both; let faction NPCs nudge.
- In the L1 Entrance, present parley via tattoo hum before initiative; success avoids damage and grants lore.
- Back at the Guild, basement shadows reflect seal strain; Eldon/Tessa provide guidance without spilling the full truth.
