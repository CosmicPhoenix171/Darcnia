# Eldon Thorne – Guild Master of Guild Crystalia

---

- **Role**: Guild Master of Guild Crystalia
- **Personality**: Old, eccentric, sharp-minded, sometimes forgetful but deeply intuitive
- **Alignment**: [Placeholder — likely Lawful Good or Neutral Good]

## Appearance
- Long grey hair, often tied back or hanging loose
- Spectacles with small lenses, perched on his nose
- Patchwork robes of various fabrics and colors, collected over decades
- Carries a worn staff or walking stick, inscribed with old guild symbols

## Background
- Has served as Guild Master for decades, inheriting the role from a long line of predecessors
- Deep knowledge of Guild Crystalia's history — though some records have been lost or obscured
- Long history with the Heartstone and the guild's "old magic," though he doesn't fully understand its origins
- Knows fragments of ancient lore about Sophia, but believes she is only a myth or legend
- Has recently been troubled by strange dreams and occurrences in the guild hall

## Knowledge & Suspicions

### What He Inherited (Guild Secrets Passed Down)
When Eldon became Guildmaster, the previous Guildmaster shared certain protected truths:
- **Sophia was the founder** - She created Guild Crystalia centuries ago
- **She made a great sacrifice** - The exact nature is unclear from fragmented records
- **The Heartstone is connected to her** - Her magic or essence is somehow tied to it
- **Sophia's spirit still lingers** - She manifests within the guild (cover story: "eccentric member")
- **The truth must be protected** - The previous Guildmaster instructed him to maintain the facade

### What He Knows
- Sophia was Guild Crystalia's founder, a legendary mage of immense power
- She performed some kind of sealing ritual centuries ago
- The Heartstone beneath the guild is tied to her magic and the resurrection system
- Sophia's spirit manifests in the guild - he must treat her as a normal member
- Strange occurrences have been increasing: whispers, dreams, feelings of being watched
- The guild's magic is failing slowly - resurrections feel "heavier" than they used to

### What He Suspects But Can't Prove
- Sophia is trapped, not just "lingering" - her manifestations seem desperate
- The resurrection system might be harming something or someone
- The dungeon beneath Solspire is connected to Sophia's sacrifice
- The guild's decline may be tied to the weakening of whatever Sophia sealed
- Other guilds might know pieces of the truth they're not sharing

### What He Doesn't Know (The Full Truth)
- Sophia is alive and conscious, suffering within the Heartstone
- Every resurrection directly drains Sophia's strength and will
- The dungeon is a layered seal - clearing floors weakens Sophia's prison
- The "wish at the end" is a lie planted by the sealed evil
- The Big Bad is using adventurers to break free
- Sophia's spirit manifestations are her desperately trying to warn them

## Relationship with the Party
- **First meeting**: Eldon welcomes Nyra (and the party) to Guild Crystalia during Session 01
- **Role**: Mentor, quest-giver, source of lore and guidance
- **Dynamic**: Eccentric but wise; offers cryptic advice and small tasks to test the party's abilities
- **Hooks**:
  - May share stories or myths about "the first guild master"
  - Could ask the party to investigate strange occurrences in the basement
  - Might confide his suspicions about the Heartstone if the party gains his trust

## Secrets & Personal Ties
- **Past mistakes**: [Placeholder — has he unknowingly contributed to weakening the seal?]
- **Family or connections**: [Placeholder — does he have ties to other guilds or factions?]
- **Hidden knowledge**: May possess fragments of Sophia's journals or old guild records

## DM Combat Notes

**Eldon should never be in direct combat unless**:
- Guild hall is under attack
- Party needs magical support against major threat
- Dramatic story moment requires it

**If Eldon dies**: Major campaign impact. Party loses mentor and information source. Guild Crystalia falls into disarray.

## Notes for the DM
- Eldon is a sympathetic NPC who wants to do the right thing but is limited by incomplete knowledge
- Use him as a source of lore, quests, and moral guidance
- He may become a key ally once the truth is revealed — or a tragic figure if he realizes his role in weakening the seal
- Consider: Does he eventually learn the truth? How does he react?
