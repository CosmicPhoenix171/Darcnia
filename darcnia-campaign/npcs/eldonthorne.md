# Eldon Thorne – Guild Master of Guild Crystalia

---

- **Role**: Guild Master of Guild Crystalia
- **Personality**: Old, eccentric, sharp-minded, sometimes forgetful but deeply intuitive
- **Alignment**: [Placeholder — likely Lawful Good or Neutral Good]

## Appearance
- Long grey hair, often tied back or hanging loose
- Spectacles with small lenses, perched on his nose
- Patchwork robes of various fabrics and colors, collected over decades
- Carries a worn staff or walking stick, inscribed with old guild symbols

## Background
- Has served as Guild Master for decades, inheriting the role from a long line of predecessors
- Deep knowledge of Guild Crystalia's history — though some records have been lost or obscured
- Long history with the Heartstone and the guild's "old magic," though he doesn't fully understand its origins
- Knows fragments of ancient lore about Sophia, but believes she is only a myth or legend
- Has recently been troubled by strange dreams and occurrences in the guild hall

## Knowledge & Suspicions
- **What he knows**:
  - The guild was founded long ago by a legendary figure (but the details are vague)
  - The Heartstone exists beneath the guild and is tied to the resurrection system
  - The guild's magic is old and powerful, but its source is mysterious
  - Strange occurrences have been increasing: whispers, dreams, feelings of being watched
- **What he suspects but can't prove**:
  - Something is wrong with the seal or the Heartstone
  - The guild's decline may be connected to a larger pattern
  - The dungeon beneath Solspire is more than just a trial
- **What he doesn't know**:
  - Sophia is alive and conscious within the Heartstone
  - The resurrection system drains her strength
  - The dungeon is a layered seal, and clearing it weakens Sophia's prison

## Relationship with the Party
- **First meeting**: Eldon welcomes Nyra (and the party) to Guild Crystalia during Session 01
- **Role**: Mentor, quest-giver, source of lore and guidance
- **Dynamic**: Eccentric but wise; offers cryptic advice and small tasks to test the party's abilities
- **Hooks**:
  - May share stories or myths about "the first guild master"
  - Could ask the party to investigate strange occurrences in the basement
  - Might confide his suspicions about the Heartstone if the party gains his trust

## Secrets & Personal Ties
- **Past mistakes**: [Placeholder — has he unknowingly contributed to weakening the seal?]
- **Family or connections**: [Placeholder — does he have ties to other guilds or factions?]
- **Hidden knowledge**: May possess fragments of Sophia's journals or old guild records

**Scholar**: Eldon has advantage on Intelligence checks related to Guild Crystalia's history, Sophia, or the Heartstone.

## DM Combat Notes

**Eldon should never be in direct combat unless**:
- Guild hall is under attack
- Party needs magical support against major threat
- Dramatic story moment requires it

**If Eldon dies**: Major campaign impact. Party loses mentor and information source. Guild Crystalia falls into disarray.

## Notes for the DM
- Eldon is a sympathetic NPC who wants to do the right thing but is limited by incomplete knowledge
- Use him as a source of lore, quests, and moral guidance
- He may become a key ally once the truth is revealed — or a tragic figure if he realizes his role in weakening the seal
- Consider: Does he eventually learn the truth? How does he react?
