## Class Features

**Level 20 Build:** Wizard (Abjuration) 17 / Cleric (Life Domain) 3

**Spellcasting.** Sophia is a 17th-level wizard and 3rd-level cleric. Her spellcasting ability is Intelligence for wizard spells (spell save DC 19, +11 to hit with spell attacks) and Wisdom for cleric spells (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks).

**Arcane Ward (Abjuration).** Sophia has a magical ward that has 51 hit points (17 × 2 + 17). Whenever she casts an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains hit points equal to twice the level of the spell. When she takes damage, the ward takes the damage instead. If the ward is reduced to 0 hit points, Sophia takes any remaining damage.

**Projected Ward.** When a creature that Sophia can see within 30 feet takes damage, she can use her reaction to cause her Arcane Ward to absorb that damage instead.

**Spell Resistance (Abjuration).** Sophia has advantage on saving throws against spells, and she has resistance to damage from spells.

**Channel Divinity (1/rest).** Sophia can channel divine energy. She has access to:
- **Preserve Life** (Life Domain): As an action, restore hit points equal to 5 × her cleric level (15 HP total) to creatures within 30 feet (divided as she chooses).

**Protective Sacrifice.** As a reaction when an ally within 60 feet would be reduced to 0 hit points, Sophia can expend a spell slot to prevent the damage and restore hit points equal to 5 × the spell slot level.

**Heartstone Connection.** While within 1 mile of the Heartstone, Sophia has advantage on all saving throws and can cast *sending* at will without using a spell slot (targeting only those marked with Guild Crest Tattoos).

## Combat Tactics

**Defensive Positioning:** Sophia prioritizes protecting allies with her Arcane Ward and Projected Ward ability. She uses *shield* and her Spell Resistance to stay alive.

**Control & Support:** Opens combat with *wall of force* or *globe of invulnerability* to protect the party. Uses *counterspell* liberally to shut down enemy casters.

**Healing:** Uses cleric spells (*healing word*, *cure wounds*) to keep allies alive while maintaining concentration on battlefield control spells.

**Final Resort:** If the seal is breaking or allies are dying, she may sacrifice a 9th-level spell slot to cast *imprisonment* or *wish* to contain threats.

- **No Legendary Actions**

- **Confused Casting:** Must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom save to cast spells above 3rd level (she doesn't remember how)
- **Memory Restoration:** Once she regains her memory at the Heartstone (Level 9+), these limitations are removed

## Notes for Combat

### When to Use Sophia in Combat

**Early Campaign (Levels 1-4):**
- Sophia rarely engages in direct combat
- If guild is attacked, she helps evacuate and protect civilians
- Uses defensive magic only (shields, barriers)
- Still has amnesia - confused about her own abilities

**Mid Campaign (Levels 5-8):**
- May assist party if they're in mortal danger near the guild
- Limited spell selection due to memory problems
- Focuses on healing and protection
- Cannot use 9th-level spells yet

**Late Campaign (Levels 9+):**
- After memory restoration, can fight at full power
- Willing to sacrifice herself to protect the seal
- May join party for final confrontation with the Big Bad
- Her death would break the seal immediately

### DM Tips

- **Don't make her a crutch** - The party should feel their victories are earned
- **Use her sparingly** - Her presence should feel significant and rare
- **Emotional weight** - Every spell she casts weakens the seal slightly
- **Sacrifice moments** - Let her use Protective Sacrifice to save a PC at critical moments
- **Final battle** - Consider whether she fights alongside the party or holds the seal at the cost of her life
