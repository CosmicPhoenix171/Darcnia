## Relationship with the Party

### First Meeting (Session 01)
**Setting:** Tessa brings the party to meet Eldon in his office.

**Eldon's Greeting:**
*Eldon looks up from a cluttered desk covered in old maps and ledgers. He removes his spectacles and smiles warmly.*

**Eldon:** "Ah! Welcome, welcome to Guild Crystalia. Tessa tells me you're interested in joining our ranks?" *gestures to chairs* "Please, sit. I'm Eldon Thorne, Guild Master - though that's just a fancy title for 'the old man who worries too much.'" *chuckles softly*

**Key Points:**
- Warm and welcoming, puts the party at ease
- Asks about their backgrounds and motivations
- Explains the guild's purpose and history (surface-level)
- Offers the Guild Crest Tattoo and explains its benefits
- Provides a small starter quest to prove their abilities

## Interactions with Sophia

### The Cover Story
**When party asks about Sophia:**

**Eldon:** *clears throat* "Ah, Sophia. Yes, she's... our spirit guardian. Been with the guild since the founding, watching over us. Quite harmless, really. Protective, if anything." *adjusts spectacles nervously* "Just part of Guild Crystalia's old magic. Nothing to worry about."

**If pressed further:**

**Eldon:** *looks uncomfortable* "Spirit forms can be... forgetful. She doesn't remember much about herself, and honestly, I don't know much more than you do. The previous Guildmaster told me to treat her respectfully and let her be. So I do." *changes subject quickly*

### When Sophia Appears
*Sophia walks into the room. Eldon's hands grip his staff tighter, but he forces a smile.*

**Eldon:** "Ah, Sophia! Good to see you. We were just... discussing guild matters." *voice slightly higher than normal*

*After Sophia leaves:*

**Eldon:** *exhales deeply* "She... doesn't know who she really is. I suspect she's trapped somehow, cursed perhaps. But every time I try to help, she just looks at me with confusion." *voice drops* "It breaks my heart."

## Campaign Progression

### Early Game (Levels 1-4): The Mentor

**Quest Giver:**
**Eldon:** "I have a small task for you. Nothing dangerous - just check the basement storage. Some guild members reported strange noises. Probably rats, but..." *trails off* "Best to be sure."

**Deflecting Questions:**
**Player:** "What's in the deep chambers?"
**Eldon:** "Oh, just old storage. Guild records, that sort of thing. Nothing exciting, I'm afraid." *changes subject* "Now, about that shipment from the Merchants' Concord..."

---

### Mid Game (Levels 5-8): The Confessor

**Opening Up:**
*Eldon invites the party to his private study. The room is cluttered with ancient books and scrolls.*

**Eldon:** "I need to be honest with you. There are things about this guild... secrets I've inherited. Sophia - she wasn't always like this. She was Guild Crystalia's founder. A legendary mage who made some kind of sacrifice centuries ago." *removes spectacles, rubs eyes tiredly* "The previous Guildmaster told me to protect the secret, to maintain the cover story. But I don't know why. I don't know what I'm protecting her from - or what I'm protecting the world from."

**Sharing Suspicions:**
**Eldon:** "The resurrections... they feel different lately. Heavier. Like I'm pulling someone back through thick mud. And Sophia - have you noticed? She seems more troubled. More desperate. I think something is wrong with the Heartstone, but I don't know what."

---

### Late Game (Levels 9+): The Ally

**After the Party Discovers the Truth:**
*Eldon sits heavily in his chair, looking older than ever.*

**Eldon:** "So it's true. All this time, we've been... breaking the seal. Every adventurer we sent into that dungeon. Every resurrection we performed." *voice breaks* "I've been Guild Master for thirty years. How many times have I contributed to her suffering? How many?"

*He looks up at the party with determination.*

**Eldon:** "Tell me what you need. Archives, resources, my magic - whatever it takes. We have to fix this. We have to save her."

**Offering Access to the Heartstone:**
**Eldon:** "I have a key. The previous Guildmaster gave it to me but told me to never use it. It leads to the deepest chamber beneath the guild." *hands over an old ornate key* "I think... I think that's where you'll find the truth. And perhaps, a way to help Sophia."

## Sample Dialogue by Topic

### On the Guild's History
**Eldon:** "Guild Crystalia was founded three centuries ago by a legendary mage. Or so the stories say. Most of the records from that time have been lost or... obscured. What we know is that the guild has always been tied to the Heartstone - that great crystal beneath our halls. It powers the resurrection magic in your tattoos."

### On the Dungeon
**Eldon:** "The dungeon has been there as long as the city. Many guilds send adventurers into its depths, seeking glory and the promised wish at the end." *looks troubled* "Though I wonder sometimes if that wish is real, or just a story we tell ourselves."

### On the Resurrection System
**Eldon:** "The Guild Crest Tattoo binds you to the Heartstone. If you fall in battle, the magic will pull you back, resurrect you at the guild. It's saved countless lives over the centuries." *pauses* "Though lately, I've wondered at what cost."

### On Other Guilds
**Eldon:** "We cooperate with the other guilds, though not always smoothly. The Crimson Vanguard thinks we're too cautious. The City Watch thinks we enable recklessness. The Merchants' Concord just wants their cut." *sighs* "Politics. Even in a guild of adventurers."

## Use of Divination Magic

### Portent (In Roleplay)
*Eldon's eyes go distant for a moment.*

**Eldon:** "I saw something this morning. A vision, perhaps. Two paths diverging. I rolled the dice of fate and saw..." *names the portent rolls* "...I'm not sure what it means, but I have a feeling one of you will need this knowledge soon."

*Later, when a party member makes a crucial roll:*

**DM:** "As you reach for the ancient artifact, Eldon's voice echoes in your mind: 'Use the seven.' Your hand steadies, and you know with certainty you will succeed." *Replace their roll with Eldon's portent of 7 (or whatever number helps)*

### Augury (For Guidance)
**Party asks about a dangerous quest:**

**Eldon:** *casts augury* "Give me a moment..." *rolls bones or consults cards* "The omens say... weal. Good fortune, though perhaps not without cost. I sense you should proceed, but carefully."

## Roleplay Tips for the DM

### Early Campaign
- Play him as a friendly mentor who's slightly secretive
- He wants to help but holds back information "for their own good"
- Use his nervousness around Sophia to create mystery
- His Divination magic can provide helpful hints without spoiling secrets

### Mid Campaign
- Show his internal conflict - wanting to tell the truth but afraid of consequences
- Let him gradually reveal more as the party proves trustworthy
- His guilt becomes more apparent as strange occurrences increase
- Uses *sending* spell to check on the party during dangerous quests

### Late Campaign
- Fully committed to helping the party save Sophia
- May offer to sacrifice himself if needed
- His knowledge of the guild's layout and history becomes crucial
- Can provide magical support (scrying, divination, defensive wards)

## Notes for the DM

- Eldon is the party's moral anchor - reliable, trustworthy, flawed but trying his best
- His incomplete knowledge mirrors the party's journey of discovery
- Use him to deliver exposition naturally through conversation
- His guilt about the seal makes the stakes personal
- Don't kill him off casually - his death should mean something if it happens
- He represents the tragedy of good intentions without full information
