## Class Features

**Level 5 Wizard (School of Divination)**

**Spellcasting.** Eldon is a 5th-level wizard. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks).

**Portent (Divination).** When Eldon finishes a long rest, he rolls two d20s and records the numbers. He can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by himself or a creature he can see with one of these foretelling rolls. He must choose to do so before the roll. Each foretelling roll can be used only once.

*At the start of each day, the DM rolls 2d20 for Eldon's portent rolls.*

**Divination Savant.** The gold and time Eldon must spend to copy a divination spell into his spellbook is halved.

**Expert Divination.** When Eldon casts a divination spell of 2nd level or higher using a spell slot, he regains one expended spell slot (the slot must be of a level lower than the spell he cast and no higher than 5th level).

**Frail.** Eldon is not a combatant. He has disadvantage on Strength checks and saving throws. He avoids combat whenever possible.

## Combat Tactics

### Avoid Combat
Eldon is NOT a combatant. If combat breaks out:
1. **First Round:** Cast *shield* if attacked, then *misty step* to safety
2. **Second Round:** Use *message* or *sending* to call for help
3. **Subsequent Rounds:** Hide, maintain distance, cast utility spells to help allies

### Support Role (If Forced to Fight)
- Uses *portent* to help allies succeed on crucial rolls
- Casts *dispel magic* to remove enemy buffs or hazards
- Uses *shield* and *misty step* to stay alive
- Calls for guild guards using Guild Master's Authority

### Never Fights Directly
- Eldon will NEVER engage in melee combat voluntarily
- His quarterstaff is purely defensive
- If surrounded with no escape, he surrenders rather than fights

## Divination Magic in Gameplay

### Portent Examples

**Example 1: Saving a PC**
*A party member is about to make a death saving throw.*
**DM:** "Eldon's voice echoes in your mind: 'Not today.' You feel a surge of certainty."
*Replace their roll with Eldon's high portent roll (e.g., 18), guaranteeing success.*

**Example 2: Ensuring Success**
*The rogue is attempting to pick a crucial lock.*
**Eldon:** "Wait. I had a vision of this moment." *Uses portent to replace the roll with a high number.*

**Example 3: Forcing Failure**
*An enemy is about to land a critical hit on a weak party member.*
**DM:** "Eldon mutters an incantation. The enemy's blade wavers mid-swing."
*Replace the attack roll with Eldon's low portent roll (e.g., 3), causing the attack to miss.*

### Augury Uses

**Before a Quest:**
**Eldon:** *casts augury* "Should we pursue the rumors in the basement?" 
*DM rolls - Result: Weal (good fortune)*
**Eldon:** "The omens are favorable. Proceed with caution."

**When Party is Deciding:**
**Eldon:** "Let me consult the bones..." *casts augury about entering the dungeon's 5th floor*
*DM rolls - Result: Woe (disaster)*
**Eldon:** *face pales* "The omens warn of great danger. Perhaps you should reconsider."

### Sending for Support

**During Dangerous Quests:**
**Eldon:** *casts sending* "Are you safe? The guild trembled. Something is wrong. Return if you can." *waits for 25-word response*

---

## When to Use Eldon in Combat

### RARELY - He's Not a Combatant

**Appropriate Times:**
- Guild hall is directly attacked
- Party desperately needs magical support against overwhelming odds
- Dramatic moment requires his sacrifice or intervention
- He uses *portent* to save a PC from certain death

**Inappropriate Times:**
- Random encounters
- Dungeon delving (he stays at the guild)
- Street fights or tavern brawls

---

## If Eldon Dies

### Campaign Impact
- **Guild Crystalia falls into disarray** - No leadership
- **Party loses their mentor** - Emotional devastation
- **Information is lost** - His knowledge of secrets dies with him
- **Sophia has no ally** - She loses someone who knew her truth
- **Other guilds may move in** - Political vacuum

### Death Scene (If It Happens)
*Eldon falls, staff clattering to the ground. He reaches out weakly.*

**Eldon:** *voice fading* "Sophia... the Heartstone... you have to..." *coughs* "Save her. Promise me... save her..." *presses the key into party member's hand* "Don't let my mistakes... be for nothing..."

## Notes for the DM

### Roleplay over Combat
- Eldon's value is in his knowledge, not his combat ability
- His Divination magic is for storytelling and supporting the party
- Use *portent* dramatically to save PCs at crucial moments
- His death should only happen if it serves the story meaningfully

### Support Character
- He provides information, quests, and magical consultation
- Can identify items, research lore, and provide sanctuary
- His *sending* spell keeps him connected to the party
- His guilt about the seal makes him a tragic figure

### Late Game Role
- Helps party access the Heartstone chamber
- Provides historical context for the final confrontation
- May sacrifice himself to weaken the Big Bad or protect Sophia
- His *portent* could be crucial in the final battle (if he's alive)

### Don't Make Him a Crutch
- He can't solve problems for the party
- His knowledge is incomplete - he doesn't have all the answers
- He won't go dungeon delving with them
- His power is limited compared to the threats they'll face
