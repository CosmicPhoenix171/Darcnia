## Knowledge & Suspicions

### What He Inherited (Guild Secrets Passed Down)
When Eldon became Guildmaster, the previous Guildmaster shared certain protected truths:
- **Sophia was the founder** - She created Guild Crystalia centuries ago
- **She made a great sacrifice** - The exact nature is unclear from fragmented records
- **The Heartstone is connected to her** - Her magic or essence is somehow tied to it
- **Sophia's spirit still lingers** - She manifests within the guild (cover story: "spirit guardian")
- **The truth must be protected** - The previous Guildmaster instructed him to maintain the facade

### What He Knows
- Sophia was Guild Crystalia's founder, a legendary mage of immense power
- She performed some kind of sealing ritual centuries ago
- The Heartstone beneath the guild is tied to her magic and the resurrection system
- Sophia's spirit manifests in the guild - he must treat her as a normal member
- Strange occurrences have been increasing: whispers, dreams, feelings of being watched
- The guild's magic is failing slowly - resurrections feel "heavier" than they used to
- Other guilds have access to the dungeon, but none understand its true nature

### What He Suspects But Can't Prove
- Sophia is trapped, not just "lingering" - her manifestations seem desperate
- The resurrection system might be harming something or someone
- The dungeon beneath Solspire is connected to Sophia's sacrifice
- The guild's decline may be tied to the weakening of whatever Sophia sealed
- Other guilds might know pieces of the truth they're not sharing
- Sophia's amnesia is not natural - it's a curse or spell

### What He Doesn't Know (The Full Truth)
- Sophia is alive and conscious, suffering within the Heartstone
- Every resurrection directly drains Sophia's strength and will
- The dungeon is a layered seal - clearing floors weakens Sophia's prison
- The "wish at the end" is a lie planted by the sealed evil
- The Big Bad is using adventurers to break free
- Sophia's spirit manifestations are her desperately trying to warn them
- Her amnesia is the Big Bad's final curse to ensure the seal breaks

### Past Mistakes
- Has unknowingly contributed to weakening the seal by maintaining the guild's operations

## Notes for the DM

- Eldon is a sympathetic NPC who wants to do the right thing but is limited by incomplete knowledge
- He represents the tragedy of inherited secrets - knowing just enough to worry, not enough to act
- Use him as a moral anchor - he'll support the party even when the truth is terrifying
- His Divination magic can provide cryptic hints through *augury* or *portent*
- Consider: Does he eventually learn the full truth? How does he react to knowing he's been part of the problem?
