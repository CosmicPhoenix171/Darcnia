## DM Combat Notes

**Tessa should NEVER be in combat unless**:
- Guild hall is directly attacked and she can't escape
- Used as hostage (dramatic story moment)

**If Tessa is threatened**:
- Party likely rushes to protect her (she's beloved)
- Other guild members intervene
- Creates strong emotional stakes

**If Tessa dies**: Party loses friendly contact and information source. Guild morale plummets. Eldon is devastated.

## Notes for the DM
- Tessa is a friendly, non-threatening NPC who helps the party feel welcome
- Use her to deliver rumors, hooks, and side quests in a natural way
- She can serve as comic relief or emotional support during tense moments
- If the party befriends her, she may confide her own suspicions or fears as the campaign progresses
- Consider: Does she eventually learn the truth? How does she react to the revelation?
