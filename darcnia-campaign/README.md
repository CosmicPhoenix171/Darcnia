**Genre**: High fantasy, cosmic horror, moral dilemma  
**System**: [D&D 5e / Pathfinder / other — specify as needed]

---

## Quick Summary

Darcnia is a vast, floating continent suspended in the cosmos above the Material Plane. Adventurers from all realms journey to Darcnia in search of glory, truth, and the whispered promise that those who conquer the dungeon at its heart may have their deepest wish granted.

**But Darcnia was never meant to be explored — it is not a blessing. It is a prison.**

**And the key to that prison… is a woman named Sophia.**

## Current Situation

### The Party
- **Nyra Vex** (player character; human rogue) — recently arrived in Solspire
- [Add other PCs as they join]

### Recent Events
- **Session 01**: Nyra arrived in Solspire and met Eldon Thorne (Guild Master) and Tessa Windfern (receptionist) at Guild Crystalia
- The party learned about the Guild Crest Tattoo and heard rumors of the Heartstone and the dungeon beneath the city
- Next step: Investigate the Heartstone and explore the dungeon's first level

### The Hidden Truth (DM Eyes Only)
- Sophia, the original guild master of Crystalia, sacrificed herself to seal an ancient evil beneath Solspire
- She is trapped inside the Heartstone, conscious and holding the seal together with sheer willpower
- The dungeon is not a trial — it is a layered lock, and every floor cleared weakens the seal
- The "wish at the end" is a lie planted by the sealed evil to lure adventurers deeper
- The Guild Crest Tattoo's resurrection system drains Sophia's strength with every use
- The Heartstone is cracking — and Sophia is dying

## Key Themes

- **Moral dilemma**: What do you do when the quest itself is the problem?
- **Tragic heroism**: Sophia's sacrifice and the cost of holding the line
- **Hidden truth**: Slowly revealing that the heroes may be the unwitting villains
- **Cosmic stakes**: The fate of the world rests on a single woman's will

---

## Notes for the DM

- Reveal the truth gradually through dreams, visions, ancient texts, and NPC warnings
- The party may unknowingly contribute to weakening the seal by using resurrection or clearing dungeon floors
- Consider: Do they stop adventuring to preserve Sophia's prison, or find another way?
- Sophia may attempt to communicate telepathically as the seal weakens
- Moral choice at the end: Save Sophia, stop the Big Bad, or find a third option?
